<h2 class="p6"><a name="GENERAL_INTRODUCTION" id="GENERAL_INTRODUCTION"></a>GENERAL INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>The earliest reference to Omar Khayyam dates from
the middle of the seventh century of the Hijra.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
Mohammad Shahrazuri, author of a little-used history
of learned men, bearing the title of «Nazhet-ul-Arwah,»
devotes to Khayyam the following passage:</p>

<p>«'Omar Al-Khayyami was a Nishapuri by birth and extraction.
He [may be regarded as] the successor of Abu
'Ali (Avicenna) in the various branches of philosophic
learning; but he was a man of reserved character and
disliked entertaining (<i>sayyik al-'atan</i>). While he was in
Ispahan he perused a certain book seven times and then
he knew it by heart. On his return to Nishapur he dictated
it [from memory] and on comparing it with the original
copy, it was found that the difference between them
was but slight. He was averse both to composition and
to teaching. He is the author of a handbook on natural
science, and of two pamphlets, one entitled &#8249;<i>Al-Wujud</i>&#8250;
(or &#8249;Real Existence&#8250;) and the other &#8249;<i>Al-Kawn w'al Taklif</i>.&#8250;<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
He was learned in the law, in classical Arabic, and
in history.</p>

<p>«One day Al-Khayyami went to see the Vezir, Abd-ur-Razzak,
the Chief of the Koran Readers. Abu-l-Hasan
Al-Ghazzali was with this latter [at the time], and the
two were discussing the disagreement of the Koran
Readers in regard to a certain verse. [As Omar entered]
the Vezir said, &#8249;Here we have <i>the</i> authority,&#8250; and proceeded
to ask Al-Khayyami [for his opinion] on the matter.
['Omar] enumerated the various readings of the
Readers, and explained the grounds (<i>'ilal</i>) for each one.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">xii</a></span>
He also mentioned the exceptional readings and the arguments
in favor of each, and expressed his preference
for one view in particular.</p>

<p>«Al-Ghazzali then said: &#8249;May God add such men as
thee to the number of the learned! Of a truth, I did
not think any one of the Koran Readers knew the readings
by heart to this extent&mdash;much less one of the secular
philosophers.&#8250;</p>

<p>«As for the sciences, he had mastered both mathematics
and philosophy. One day &#8249;the Proof of Islam&#8250;, Al-Ghazzali,
came to see him and asked him how it came
that one could distinguish one of the parts of the
sphere which revolve on the axis from the rest, although
the sphere was similar in all its parts. Al-Khayyami pronounced
his views, beginning with a certain category;
but he refrained from entering deeply into the discussion&mdash;and
such was the wont of this respected Sheykh.
[Their conversation was interrupted by] the call to mid-day
prayer, whereupon Al-Ghazzali said, &#8249;Truth has come
in, and lying has gone out.&#8250; 'Omar arose and went to
visit Sultan Sanjar. The latter was [at the time] a mere
child, and was suffering from an attack of smallpox.
When he came away the Vezir asked him, &#8249;How did
you find the child, and what did you prescribe for him?&#8250;
'Omar answered, &#8249;The child is in a most precarious
state.&#8250; An Ethiopian slave reported this saying to the
Sultan, and when the Sultan recovered he became inimical
to 'Omar and did not like him. Melik-Shah treated
him as a boon companion; and Shams-ul-Mulk honored
him greatly, and made him sit beside him on his throne.</p>

<p>«It is related that ['Omar] was [one day] picking his
teeth with a toothpick of gold, and was studying the
chapter on metaphysics from [Avicenna's] &#8249;Book of Healing.&#8250;
When he reached the section on &#8249;The One and
the Many&#8250; he placed the toothpick between the two
leaves, arose, performed his prayers and made his last
injunctions. He neither ate nor drank anything [that
day]; and when he performed the last evening prayer,
he bowed himself to the ground and said as he bowed:
&#8249;Oh, God! verily I have known Thee to the extent of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">xiii</a></span>
power: forgive me, therefore. Verily my knowledge of
Thee is my recommendation to Thee.&#8250; And [so saying],
he died; may God have pity on him!»</p>

<p>We may look upon Omar as a deeply learned man,
following his own convictions, who, tortured with the question
of existence, and finding no solution to life in Musulman
dogmas, worked out for himself a regular
conception of life based on Sufistic Mysticism; a man
who, without discarding belief, smiled ironically at the
inconsistencies and peculiarities of the Islam of his time,
which left many minds dissatisfied in the fourth and fifth
centuries, needing as it did vivification. It found this
in the person of Ghazzali, who in this movement assigned
the proper place to the Mystic element. Omar was a
preacher of moral purity and of a contemplative life; one
who loved his God and struggled to master the eternal,
the good, and the beautiful.</p>

<p>In this manner also is Omar portrayed in the various
early biographical notices: a defender of «Greek Science,»
famous for his knowledge of the Koran and the Law,
and at the same time a «stinging serpent» to the dogmatic;
a wit and a mocker, a bitter and implacable enemy
of all hypocrisy; a man who, while curing others of the
wounds of worldly triviality, impurity, and sinful vanity,
himself only with almost his last breath closed the philosophic
book on «Healing» and turned with a touching
prayer to the One God, the Infinite, whom he had been
striving to comprehend with all the strength of his mind
and heart. Khayyam's lively protests and his heated
words in freedom's cause brought upon him many bitter
moments in his life and exposed him to numerous attacks
at the hands of the mullahs, especially those of the
Shiite community.</p>

<p>Besides these, then as now (apart from hypocrites), persons
were not wanting who, failing to understand Omar,
regarded him as an unbeliever, atheist, and materialist.
But in the course of centuries the people of Persia and
India, realizing, perhaps instinctively, the injustice of former
reproaches, have taken to publishing and reading
Omar Khayyam in collections side by side with Abu-Said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">xiv</a></span>
Abd-Allah Ansari, and Attar&mdash;that is to say, with Sufi
Mystics of the purest water, men whose moral and religious
reputations were spotless.</p>

<p>Rightly to understand Omar some knowledge of Sufism
and its tenets is necessary. Sufism is a mystical doctrine
which had its birth on the Arabian coast, and succeeded
in implanting itself there to the point of putting a decisive
check upon the orthodox philosophy. The etymology
of the name is difficult to find. According to some, it
comes from the word <i>suf</i> (wool, a woolen garment) because
the first persons to adopt this doctrine clothed
themselves in wool.</p>

<p>We can give, as a proof, in support of this etymology,
the fact that the Persians call their dervishes Sufis,
<i>pechmineh pôch</i> (clothed in wool). The name could also
come from the Arabic <i>safou</i> (purity) or the Greek &#963;&#959;&#966;&#8055;&#945;
(wisdom). Again, some Arabic authors call by the name
of Soufa an Arabic tribe that separated themselves from
the world in the ante-Islamic period, consecrating themselves
to the keeping of the temple of Mecca. A man
who professed the Mystic principles of <i>tasawouf</i> (the
spiritual life) they called a «Sufi.»</p>

<p>The origin of Musulman Mysticism is a question entailing
some controversy, for whoever knows the detailed
ritual and the dogmatic coldness of the Koran finds it impossible
to reconcile Islamic dogma with any idea of
Mysticism whatsoever. In vain does one seek to find an
example of Mystical teaching in this aphorism attributed
to Mahomet: «It is when he prays that the faithful one
is nearest God,» as Islamism holds to a definite separation
between the Divinity and the world, between the Creator
and the thing created. The religious customs that Mahomet
instituted and the moral action that he taught
served only to merit the good-will of the Divinity; at the
utmost he only believed that he would be permitted to
see Him face to face.</p>

<p>Whence comes then this Mystical idea which, for so
many centuries, has occupied all the minds and absorbed all
the intellectual force of the Musulman world? Two different
origins can be given for it: the idea of emanation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">xv</a></span>
from and return to the divine essence whence it
came&mdash;what we call Neo-platonism. Added to this are
Contemplation and Annihilation, which come to it through
Persia and the Vedantic school as intermediaries, bringing
with it Pantheism, which made its way late into Sufism,
and almost solely among the Persians. Also, it could be
said that originally Sufism owed its principles to the
Alexandrian school.</p>

<p>The Arabs, who studied and translated the greater part
of Aristotle, knew Plato only by name; but they came
under his influence and received his doctrines, strongly
impregnated with the Mysticism of the Kabbala, through
the Alexandrians and especially through Philon. To annihilate
reason, or at least to subordinate it to feeling;
to attack liberty, in order to subject the whole of life to
love; and, furthermore, the blind abandoning of self&mdash;such
is the aim of Sufism, as it is of all Mystic philosophy.</p>

<p>The doctrine of the Sufis has been set forth in a great
number of treatises, notably that of Sohrawdi. God
alone exists; He is in everything and everything is in
Him. All beings emanate from Him, without being really
distinct from Him. The world exists for all eternity; the
material is only an illusion of the senses. Sufism is the
true philosophy of Islamism, «which is the best of religions,»
but religions have only a relative importance and
serve but to guide us toward the Reality.</p>

<p>God is the author of the acts of the human race; it is He
who controls the will of man, which is <i>not</i> free in its action.
Like all animals man possesses an original mind, an
animal or living mind, a mind instinctive, but he has
also a human mind, breathed into him by God, and of
the same character as the original and constructive element
itself. The concomitant mind comprehends the original
element and the human mind; it extends itself over the
triple domain: animal, vegetable, and mineral. The soul,
which existed before the body, is confined in the body
as in a cage; death, then is, the object of the Sufi's desires,
since it returns him to the bosom of the Divinity. This
metempsychosis permits the soul which has not fulfilled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">xvi</a></span>
its destiny here below to be purified and worthy of a
re-union with God. This spiritual union all can strive
for ardently, but all cannot attain, because it is a product
of the grace of God.</p>

<p>The Sufi, during his sojourn in the body, is uniquely
occupied in meditating upon his unity with God (<i>Wahdanija</i>),
the reminiscence of the names of God (<i>Zikr</i>), and the
progressive advancement in the <i>tarika</i> or journey of life,
up to his unification with God.</p>

<p>What is the Sufi journey, then? Human life has been
likened to a voyage, where the traveler is seeking after
God. The aim of the voyage is to attain to a knowledge
of God, for human existence is a period of banishment
for the soul, which cannot return to God until it
has passed through many successive stages. The natural
state of man is called <i>nasout</i> (humanity); the disciple
should observe the law and conform to all the rites of
believers. The other stages are: the nature of the
angels (<i>malakout</i>), where one follows the way to purity,
the possession of power (<i>djabrout</i>), the degree to which
knowledge corresponds (<i>m'arifa</i>), and finally, extinction
or absorption in the Deity, the degree to which truth
corresponds. The voyager agrees to renouncement, which
is of two kinds: external and internal. The first is the
renouncement of riches and worldly honors; the second
is the renouncement of profane desires. And he should
especially guard against idolatry, which for some is the
adoration of worldly achievement, for others a too assiduous
practice of praying and fasting.</p>

<p>To arrive at this aim, the voyager has three necessary
aids: attraction (<i>indïïdhah</i>), the act of God which
draws all men who have that tendency or inclination to
Him; devotion (<i>ibâda</i>), continuing the journey by two
roads&mdash;towards God and in God, the first limited, the
second without limit; finally, elevation (<i>ouroudi</i>). But
the voyage cannot be accomplished alone; it is necessary
to have a guide or a monitor taken from the second
class (<i>ibâda</i>). The believer who, after having been
<i>tâlib</i> (an educated man doubting the reality of God) and
<i>mourid</i> (desirous of following out his quest), becomes a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">xvii</a></span>
<i>salik</i> (traveler), places himself under the authority of a
Sufi guide who teaches him to serve God until, through
divine influence, he attains to the <i>ichk</i> (love) stage. Divine
love, removing all mundane desires from his heart,
causes him to arrive at <i>zouhd</i> (isolation); he then leads
a contemplative life, passes through the <i>m'arifa</i> degree,
and awaits the direct illumination of <i>wadja</i> (ecstasy).</p>

<p>After having received a revelation of the true nature
of God (the <i>hakika</i> stage) he arrives at the <i>wasl</i> stage
(union with God); he cannot go further; death alone remains,
by which he will arrive at the final degree, absorption
in the Divinity. The <i>Zikr</i> are only various forms
of devotion invented by the Sufi guides to develop the
spiritual life. The conduct of the disciple in the presence
of his master is determined by rules which differ
little from those imposed upon all dervishes.</p>

<p>Some authors distinguish, in the Sufi voyage, seven
stages, corresponding to the degrees in the celestial
sphere, in order to have the soul received there after
death. But, protest metaphysicians, the soul cannot return
to a determined place, since it does not come from
a determined place. Celestial intelligence, to which corresponds
the degree of intelligence reached by man, will
absorb the soul after its separation from the body.</p>

<p>The Sufis attribute a high antiquity to their doctrines.
They do not hesitate to refer them to as far back as
Abraham; they pretend that one of the founders of their
sect was own son-in-law to the prophet Ali, son of Abou-Tâlib.
Finally, «there came a pious woman from Jerusalem,
by the name of Rabia, whose words recall the
Christian Mysticism.»</p>

<p>The first person to take the name of Sufi was Abou-Hachim
of Koufa. The first convent or <i>Khanakah</i> was
founded in Khorasan by Abou-Said, the Persian, although
the prophet had prohibited monkish life in Islam. Another
convent was established at Ramia, in Syria, and Saladin
founded one in Egypt. Sufism then was divided into two
schools: The Persian Bestâmi (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 875) inclined towards
Pantheism; Djonaid, of Bagdad, preached a system reconcilable
with Musulman dogmatism. One of the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">xviii</a></span>
celebrated doctors of this school was Halladj, burnt alive
in <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 922. They discoursed upon Sufism under the
Kalifs Al-Motazz and Al-Mohtadi, and preached it under
Al-Motamid. The principal Sufi writers are: Mohammed
Salami an Nichabouri (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1021), El-Kochairi (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1072),
Ghazli (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1111), Sohrawdi (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1234), Ferid-ed-din
Attar (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1230), Djami (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1492), and Ech-Cha'rani
(<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1565).</p>

<p>This Mysticism, so sweet and so full of sentiment,
exhales itself in poesy, and is as much stamped with tenderness
and resignation as it is overflowing with sensuality
and drunkenness. The best and most illustrious of
the Persian poets are of this sect: Djelal-ed-din er-Roumi,
author of the «<i>Mesnewi</i>», Djami, author of «<i>Salaman
ou-Absa</i>», Ferid-ed-din Attar, author of «<i>Mantik-ut-tair</i>»;
S'adi, Hafiz de Chiraz, Bayazid-al-Bestami.</p>

<p>Just as Sufis leave the true faith for its semblance, so
they also exchange the external features of all things
for the internal (the corporeal for the spiritual) and give
a spiritual significance to outward forms. They behold
objects of a precious nature in their natural character,
and for this reason, the greater part of their words have
a spiritual and visionary meaning.</p>

<p>For instance, when, like Omar, they mention wine,
they mean a knowledge of God, which, extensively considered,
is the love of God. Wine, viewed extensively,
is also love: love and affection are here the same thing.
The wine-shop with them means the <i>murshid i kiamil</i>
(spiritual director), for his heart is said to be the depository
of the love of God; the wine-cup is the <i>telkin</i> (the
pronunciation of the name of God in a declaration of
faith as: There is no God but Allah), or it signifies the
words which flow from the <i>murshid's</i> mouth respecting
divine knowledge, and which, heard by the <i>salik</i> (the
Dervish, or one who pursues the true path), intoxicates
his soul, and divests his mind (of passions) giving him
pure, spiritual delight.</p>

<p>The sweetheart or Beloved means the preceptor, because,
when any one sees his beloved he admires her proportions,
with a heart full of love. The Dervish beholds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">xix</a></span>
the secret knowledge of God which fills the heart of his
spiritual preceptor (<i>murshid</i>), and through it receives a
similar inspiration, and acquires a full perception of all
that he possesses, just as the pupil learns from his master.
As the lover delights in the presence of his sweetheart, so
the Dervish rejoices in the company of his beloved preceptor.
The sweetheart is the object of a worldly affection;
but the preceptor commands a spiritual attachment.</p>

<p>The curls or ringlets of the beloved are the grateful
praises of the preceptor, tending to bind the affections
of the Dervish-pupil; the moles on her face signify that
when the pupil, at times, beholds the total absence of all
worldly wants on the part of the preceptor, he also abandons
all the desires of both worlds&mdash;he, perhaps, even
goes so far as to desire nothing else in life than his preceptor;
the furrows on the brow of the beloved one,
which they compare to verses of the Koran, mean the
light of the heart of the <i>murshid</i>: they are compared to
the verses of the Koran, because the attributes of God,
in accordance with the injunction of the Prophet: «Be
ye endued with divine qualities,» are possessed by the
sheikh (or <i>murshid</i>).</p>

<p>Perhaps I can do no better than to quote one of the
foremost authorities on Sufism<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> in regard to Omar's
teachings.</p>

<p>«Seldom has a poet suffered from his friends and his
foes as has Omar Khayyam. &#8249;He has been regarded,&#8250;
says a writer, &#8249;as a free-thinker, a subverter of faith; an
atheist and materialist; a pantheist and a scoffer at Mysticism;
an orthodox Musulman; a true philosopher, a
keen observer, a man of learning; a <i>bon vivant</i>, a profligate,
a dissembler and a hypocrite, and a blasphemer&mdash;nay,
more, an incarnate negation of positive religion and of
all moral beliefs; a gentle nature, more given to the
contemplation of things divine than worldly enjoyments;
an epicurean sceptic; the Persian Abu-l-Ala, Voltaire, and
Heine in one.&#8250; The writer has in view the well-known
criticisms of Von Hammer, Renan, Ellis, Nicolas, Garcin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">xx</a></span>
de Tassy, Whinfield, Aug. Muller, etc. He might have
added Vedder's curious misunderstanding of the &#8249;Beloved,&#8250;
making him a damsel and a playtoy, and the thousand
and one small ideas set forth by Omarian Societies.</p>

<p>«All this criticism is curious because it is so completely
out of harmony with the facts of Omar's life. It is true
that no complete, authentic manuscript of Omar's is
known, and equally true that no comprehensive biography
is known; but detailed information has come down to
us from his contemporaries. From these notes enough
can be gathered to show that Omar was a great man
indeed, one who clearly and forcibly shows the four sides
of a perfect character.</p>

<p>«A perfect character is first and fundamentally powerful.
It is based upon the One, be it in idea or in action.
Next, it is so simple and direct that all extraneous thoughts
and purposes are unknown to it. These two sides condition
one another. No power without simplicity and
no directness without power. The third side of a great
character is love or human feeling; a fullness that seeks
to draw all men to the One, and the fourth and last
characteristic is harmony or a welding together into One
of all these four. The last characteristic is, of course,
an impossibility where the others do not exist; nor can
the others attain any vividness or fullness without
love.</p>

<p>«A perfect character is rare. We see, however, glimpses
of it here and there. Omar Khayyam was a type of
perfect character. He is full of the One; he knows of
nothing but the One; he burns to draw his fellow-men to
the One; he belongs nowhere but in the One, in whom
he indeed can be said to move, live, and have his being.
In the One he attained Wholeness, harmony. Omar's philosophy
is that of the Sufis. In that, too, he is consistent.
The one is Truth; Truth is the reality of things, Truth
burns to draw men to Itself; Truth is the Law or &#8249;Universe.&#8250;
His method is Symbolism, viz.: he chooses the
transparencies of Nature in order to show his hearers
how Truth or Wisdom and Love or Devotion everywhere
appear to be the reality behind &#8249;the magic Shadow-shapes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">xxi</a></span>
that come and go.&#8250; His most prominent symbols
are Wine and Love; Roses, Springtime, and Death.</p>

<p>«Omar's ethics are not those of Mohammedanism. He
advocates Resignation, to be sure, but not Mohammedan
fatalism as popularly understood. His morals spring from
his conception of the fullness of the One, and as such
they are in harmony with the most universal notions of
mankind. In one word, Omar's theology, philosophy,
method, and morals are Sufistic, Sufism taken in the
highest sense as the unifying notion for Wholeness, Love,
Truth, and Power. A study of Sufism will reveal the
real Omar&mdash;hitherto but little known, if known at all.</p>

<pre>
       *       *       *       *       *       *       *
</pre>

<p>«No one has attempted, so far as I know, to classify the
various Sufistic systems. It is not so difficult to do so
when a key can be found to them. The best key is
that four-foldness which manifests itself in all human
character, endeavor, and work. Corresponding to the four-foldness
of character delineated above, I shall now take
the terms Life, Love, Light, and Law and say that Al-Ghazzali
and Jelaladdin represent the first and, as a
proof, point to their constant emphasis of will as being
the dominant power of existence, and the prominence
they give to moral worth. The type of Love, in the
form of poetry and feeling, is represented by Hafiz and
Jami. The third group is fully and completely filled
by Shabistani, the author of &#8249;Gulshan-i-Raz.&#8250; It is
Light, and its form is Philosophy, Truth, and Understanding.
The last, the fourth, sums up in a measure,
the three preceding, and is also a clearly defined group
by itself. It is Law, Order, Unity, and Reality. There
is more independence in it than in any of the others,
because it is the nearest approach known in existence
to Wholeness or Unity. It contains the opposites of existence,
both cosmic and human, viz.: the protest of the
Mystic and also his affirmation, and the new Hope he
represents.</p>

<p>«Omar Khayyam belongs to this fourth group. I do not
say he alone fills it. But he exhibits that Independence
and Protest which is the first and outward characteristic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">xxii</a></span>
of it. He is also from time to time soaring into the
realms of the Truth or Unity, in a way not found in any
other Sufi poet or doctor.</p>

<p>«Under the garb of the Mystic's favorite method of
Doubt and Protest, the Sufi (Omar) pictures the process of
the Awakening of the Soul. That is the purpose of the
&#8249;Magic Shadow-shapes that come and go&#8250; in the Rubaiyat
of Omar Khayyam. His pictures are sufficiently
transparent for us to see The Reality Behind.</p>

<p>«While so much is claimed for Omar, it must not be
forgotten that it has not been said that he is the only
perfect Sufi. It is not our intention to say or to intimate
that. Omar is great enough when we attribute to him
the office of an Awakener; not merely that of a John the
Baptist, but the office of one who is himself full of the
Awakening he preaches. Such an one is a unique character,
and is truly an At-oner, one who heals all wounds
and binds up broken limbs.»</p>


<p class="p2">I have already stated, if not in actual words, at least
by inference, that Khayyam's philosophical and religious
opinions were in certain essential points based upon the
teaching of the Vedantas. He must have been familiar
with the general scope of their philosophy, although attaching
himself, as we have seen, to the ranks of the
Sufi Mystics. Sufism and Babism are probably the most
widely spread doctrines current in modern Persia, and
after all are but forms of Vedantic pantheism despoiled
of real significance by the effort to accommodate
themselves to the creed of Islam. We learn from El
Kifti that Khayyam «exhorted to the seeking of the
One, the Ruler, by the purification of bodily movements,
for the cleansing of the human soul,» an unmistakable
exposition of Sufi practices, although based originally
upon the customs of the Vedantic sages.</p>

<p>He certainly did not practice asceticism and other quasi-religious
forms, which had been grafted upon the austere
simplicity of the original Vedantic creed, but he did inculcate
the necessity of acquiring «the knowledge of the
unity of the soul with God»&mdash;the one thing important&mdash;which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">xxiii</a></span>
can only be achieved by the renouncement of desire,
the purification of the soul from the lusts of the
world, and the practice of kindliness, goodness, universal
sympathy with mankind, and the patience which
brings perfect work.</p>

<p>That Omar was a man of many moods is evident. His
poetic faculties, acted upon by an intelligence that was
profound, and by a wit as cutting as the <i>tulwar</i> of a
Persian soldier, swayed him hither and thither upon the
sea of daily doubts and fears which are part of man's
existence. Yet, in his way, he was a beacon light, not
only in the history of Sufi Mysticism, but in the annals
of God-seeking. I can find no better yoke-fellow for him
than Luther, like whom he was indeed an Apostle of
Protest.</p>

ASTRONOMER-POET OF PERSIA</p>


<p>Omar Khayyam was born at Naishapur in Khorassan
in the latter half of our eleventh, and died within
the first quarter of our twelfth Century. The
slender story of his life is curiously twined about that of
two other very considerable figures in their time and
country: one of whom tells the story of all three. This
was Nizam ul Mulk, Vizyr to Alp Arslan the son, and
Malik Shah the grandson, of Toghrul Beg the Tartar, who
had wrested Persia from the feeble successor of Mahmud
the Great, and founded that Seljukian Dynasty which
finally roused Europe into the Crusades. This Nizam ul
Mulk, in his «<i>Wasiyat</i>»&mdash;or «Testament»&mdash;which he
wrote and left as a memorial for future statesmen&mdash;relates
the following, as quoted in the «Calcutta Review,»
No. lix., from Mirkhond's «History of the Assassins.»</p>

<p>«&#8249;One of the greatest of the wise men of Khorassan
was the Imam Mowaffak of Naishapur, a man highly honoured
and reverenced&mdash;may God rejoice his soul; his
illustrious years exceeded eighty-five, and it was the universal
belief that every boy who read the Koran or studied
the traditions in his presence, would assuredly attain to
honour and happiness. For this cause did my father
send me from Tus to Naishapur with Abd-us-samad, the
doctor of law, that I might employ myself in study and
learning under the guidance of that illustrious teacher.
Towards me he ever turned an eye of favour and kindness,
and as his pupil I felt for him extreme affection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
and devotion, so that I passed four years in his service.
When I first came there, I found two other pupils of
mine own age newly arrived, Hakim Omar Khayyam, and
the ill-fated Ben Sabbah. Both were endowed with
sharpness of wit and the highest natural powers; and we
three formed a close friendship together. When the
Imam rose from his lectures, they used to join me, and
we repeated to each other the lessons we had heard.
Now Omar was a native of Naishapur, while Hasan Ben
Sabbah's father was one Ali, a man of austere life and
practice, but heretical in his creed and doctrine. One
day Hasan said to me and to Khayyam, «It is a universal
belief that the pupils of the Imam Mowaffak will attain
to fortune. Now, even if we <i>all</i> do not attain
thereto, without doubt one of us will, what then shall be
our mutual pledge and bond?» We answered, «Be it
what you please.»&mdash;«Well,» he said, «let us make a vow,
that to whomsoever this fortune falls, he shall share it
equally with the rest, and reserve no pre-eminence for
himself.»&mdash;«Be it so,» we both replied, and on those
terms we mutually pledged our words. Years rolled on,
and I went from Khorassan to Transoxiana, and wandered
to Ghazni and Cabul; and when I returned, I was invested
with office, and rose to be administrator of affairs
during the Sultanate of Sultan Alp Arslan.&#8250;</p>

<p>«He goes on to state, that years passed by, and both
his old school-friends found him out, and came and
claimed a share in his good fortune, according to the
school-day vow. The Vizier was generous and kept his
word. Hasan demanded a place in the government,
which the Sultan granted at the Vizier's request; but,
discontented with a gradual rise, he plunged into the
maze of intrigue of an Oriental court, and, failing in
a base attempt to supplant his benefactor, he was disgraced
and fell. After many mishaps and wanderings,
Hasan became the head of the Persian sect of the <i>Ismailians</i>&mdash;a
party of fanatics who had long murmured
in obscurity, but rose to an evil eminence under the
guidance of his strong and evil will. In <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1090, he
seized the castle of Alamut, in the province of Rudbar,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
which lies in the mountainous tract south of the Caspian
Sea; and it was from this mountain home he obtained
that evil celebrity among the Crusaders as the OLD
MAN OF THE MOUNTAINS, and spread terror
through the Mohammedan world; and it is yet disputed
whether the word <i>Assassin</i>, which they have left in the
language of modern Europe as their dark memorial, is
derived from the <i>hashish</i>, or opiate of hemp-leaves (the
Indian <i>bhang</i>), with which they maddened themselves to
the sullen pitch of Oriental desperation, or from the
name of the founder of the dynasty, whom we have
seen in his quiet collegiate days, at Naishapur. One of
the countless victims of the Assassin's dagger was Nizam
ul Mulk himself, the old school-boy friend.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>«Omar Khayyam also came to the Vizier to claim his
share; but not to ask for title or office. &#8249;The greatest
boon you can confer on me,&#8250; he said, &#8249;is to let me live in
a corner under the shadow of your fortune, to spread wide,
the advantages of Science, and pray for your long life
and prosperity.&#8250; The Vizier tells us, that, when he found
Omar was really sincere in his refusal, he pressed him
no further, but granted him a yearly pension of 1200
<i>mithkals</i> of gold, from the treasury of Naishapur.»</p>

<p>«At Naishapur thus lived and died Omar Khayyam,
&#8249;busied,&#8250; adds the Vizier, &#8249;in winning knowledge of every
kind, and especially in Astronomy, wherein he attained
to a very high pre-eminence. Under the Sultanate of
Malik Shah he came to Merv, and obtained great praise
for his proficiency in science, and the Sultan showered
favours upon him.&#8250;</p>

<p>«When Malik Shah determined to reform the calendar,
Omar was one of the eight learned men employed to do
it; the result was the <i>Jalali</i> era (so called from <i>Jalal-ud-din</i>
one of the king's names)&mdash;&#8249;a computation of time,&#8250;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
says Gibbon, &#8249;which surpasses the Julian, and approaches
the accuracy of the Gregorian style.&#8250; He is also the
author of some astronomical tables, entitled &#8249;<i>Ziji-Malik-skahi,&#8250;»</i>
and the French have lately republished and
translated an Arabic treatise of his on algebra.</p>

<p>«His Takhallus or poetical name (Khayyam) signifies a
Tentmaker, and he is said to have at one time exercised
that trade, perhaps before Nizam ul Mulk's generosity
raised him to independence. Many Persian poets similarly
derive their names from their occupations; thus we have
Attar, &#8249;a druggist,&#8250; Assar, &#8249;an oil presser,&#8250; etc.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Omar
himself alludes to his name in the following whimsical
lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">«&#8249;Khayyam, who stitched the tents of science,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has fallen in grief's furnace and been suddenly burned;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shears of Fate have cut the tent ropes of his life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the broker of Hope has sold him for nothing!&#8250;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>«We have only one more anecdote to give of his life,
and that relates to the close; it is told in the anonymous
preface which is sometimes prefixed to his poems; it has
been printed in the Persian in the appendix to Hyde's
&#8249;Veterum Persarum Religio,&#8250; p. 499; and D'Herbelot alludes
to it in his <i>Bibliothèque</i>, under <i>Khiam</i>:<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>&mdash;</p>

<p>«&#8249;It is written in the chronicles of the ancients that
this King of the Wise, Omar Khayyam, died at Naishapur
in the year of the Hegira 517 (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1123); in science he
was unrivalled,&mdash;the very paragon of his age. Khwajah
Nizami of Samarcand, who was one of his pupils, relates
the following story: «I often used to hold conversations
with my teacher Omar Khayyam, in a garden; and one day
he said to me, &#8249;My tomb shall be in a spot where the
north wind may scatter roses over it.&#8250; I wondered at
the words he spake, but I knew that his were no idle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
words.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Years after, when I chanced to revisit Naishapur,
I went to his final resting-place, and lo! it was just
outside a garden, and trees laden with fruit stretched
their boughs over the garden wall, and dropped their
flowers upon his tomb, so that the stone was hidden under
them.»&#8250;»</p>

<p>Thus far&mdash;without fear of trespass&mdash;from the «Calcutta
Review.» The writer of it, on reading in India
this story of Omar's grave, was reminded, he says, of
Cicero's account of finding Archimedes' tomb at Syracuse,
buried in grass and weeds. I think Thorwaldsen desired
to have roses grow over him; a wish religiously fulfilled
for him to the present day, I believe. However, to return
to Omar.</p>

<p>Though the Sultan «shower'd favours upon him,»
Omar's Epicurean audacity of thought and speech caused
him to be regarded askance in his own time and country.
He is said to have been especially hated and dreaded
by the Sufis, whose practice he ridiculed, and whose
faith amounts to little more than his own, when stript
of the Mysticism and formal recognition of Islamism
under which Omar would not hide. Their poets, including
Hafiz, who are (with the exception of Firdausi) the
most considerable in Persia, borrowed largely, indeed, of
Omar's material, but turning it to a mystical use more
convenient to themselves and the people they addressed;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
a people quite as quick of doubt as of belief; as keen
of bodily sense as of intellectual; and delighting in a
cloudy composition of both, in which they could float
luxuriously between heaven and earth, and this world
and the next, on the wings of a poetical expression, that
might serve indifferently for either Omar was too
honest of heart as well as of head for this. Having
failed (however mistakenly) of finding any Providence
but destiny, and any world but this, he set about making
the most of it; preferring rather to soothe the soul
through the senses into acquiescence with things as he saw
them, than to perplex it with vain disquietude after what
they <i>might</i> be. It has been seen, however, that his
worldly ambition was not exorbitant; and he very likely
takes a humorous or perverse pleasure in exalting the
gratification of sense above that of the intellect, in which
he must have taken great delight, although it failed to
answer the questions in which he, in common with all
men, was most vitally interested.</p>

<p>For whatever reason, however, Omar, as before said,
has never been popular in his own country, and therefore
has been but scantily transmitted abroad. The
MSS. of his Poems, mutilated beyond the average casualties
of Oriental transcription, are so rare in the East as
scarce to have reached westward at all, in spite of all
the acquisitions of arms and science. There is no copy
at the India House, none at the Bibliothèque Nationale
of Paris. We know but of one in England: No. 140 of
the Ouseley MSS. at the Bodleian, written at Shiraz,
<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1460. This contains but 158 Rubaiyat. One in the
Asiatic Society's Library at Calcutta (of which we have
a copy) contains (and yet incomplete) 516, though swelled
to that by all kinds of repetition and corruption. So
Von Hammer speaks of <i>his</i> copy as containing about
200, while Dr. Sprenger catalogues the Lucknow MS. at
double that number.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> The scribes, too, of the Oxford<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
and Calcutta MSS. seem to do their work under a sort
of protest; each beginning with a tetrastich (whether
genuine or not), taken out of its alphabetical order; the
Oxford with one of apology; the Calcutta with one of expostulation,
supposed (says a notice prefixed to the MS.)
to have arisen from a dream, in which Omar's mother
asked about his future fate. It may be rendered thus&mdash;</p>

<p>The reviewer,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> to whom I owe the particulars of Omar's
life, concludes his review by comparing him with Lucretius,
both as to natural temper and genius, and as acted
upon by the circumstances in which he lived. Both indeed
were men of subtle, strong, and cultivated intellect,
fine imagination, and hearts passionate for truth and
justice; who justly revolted from their country's false
religion, and false, or foolish, devotion to it, but who
fell short of replacing what they subverted by such better
<i>hope</i> as others, with no better revelation to guide them,
had yet made a law to themselves. Lucretius, indeed,
with such material as Epicurus furnished, satisfied himself
with the theory of a vast machine fortuitously constructed,
and acting by a law that implied no legislator; and so
composing himself into a Stoical rather than Epicurean
severity of attitude, sat down to contemplate the mechanical
drama of the Universe which he was part actor in;
himself and all about him (as in his own sublime description
of the Roman Theatre) discolored with the lurid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
reflex of the curtain suspended between the spectator and
the sun. Omar, more desperate, or more careless of any
so complicated system as resulted in nothing but hopeless
necessity, flung his own genius and learning with a bitter
or humorous jest into the general ruin which their insufficient
glimpses only served to reveal; and, pretending
sensual pleasure as the serious purpose of life, only <i>diverted</i>
himself with speculative problems of Deity, Destiny,
Matter and Spirit, Good and Evil, and other such
questions, easier to start than to run down, and the pursuit
of which becomes a very weary sport at last!</p>

<p>With regard to the present translation. The original
Rubaiyat (as, missing an Arabic guttural, these <i>Tetrastichs</i>
are more musically called) are independent stanzas,
consisting each of four lines of equal, though varied,
prosody; sometimes <i>all</i> rhyming, but oftener (as here
imitated) the third line a blank. Somewhat as in the
Greek alcaic, where the penultimate line seems to lift
and suspend the wave that falls over in the last. As
usual with such kind of Oriental verse, the Rubaiyat
follow one another according to alphabetic rhyme&mdash;a
strange succession of grave and gay. Those here selected
are strung into something of an eclogue, with perhaps a
less than equal proportion of the «Drink and make-merry»
which (genuine or not) recurs over-frequently in the
original. Either way the result is sad enough: saddest
perhaps when most ostentatiously merry: more apt to
move sorrow than anger toward the old Tentmaker, who,
after vainly endeavouring to unshackle his steps from
destiny, and to catch some authentic glimpse of <span class="smcap">To-morrow</span>,
fell back upon <span class="smcap">To-day</span> (which has outlasted so
many <span class="smcap">To-morrows</span>!) as the only ground he had got to
stand upon, however momentarily slipping from under
his feet.</p>


<p class="p2">While the second Edition of this version of Omar was
preparing, M. Nicolas, French Consul at Resht, published
a very careful and very good edition of the text, from a
lithograph copy at Teheran, comprising 464 Rubaiyat,
with translation and notes of his own.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span></p>

<p>M. Nicolas, whose edition has reminded me of several
things, and instructed me in others, does not consider
Omar to be the material Epicurean that I have literally
taken him for, but a Mystic, shadowing the Deity under
the figure of wine, wine-bearer, etc., as Hafiz is supposed
to do; in short, a Sufi Poet like Hafiz and the
rest.</p>

<p>I cannot see reason to alter my opinion, formed as it
was more than a dozen years ago<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> when Omar was first
shown me by one to whom I am indebted for all I know
of Oriental, and very much of other, literature. He admired
Omar's genius so much, that he would gladly have
adopted any such interpretation of his meaning as M.
Nicolas' if he could.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> That he could not, appears by his
paper in the «Calcutta Review» already so largely quoted;
in which he argues from the Poems themselves, as well
as from what records remain of the Poet's Life.</p>

<p>And if more were needed to disprove M. Nicolas' theory,
there is the Biographical Notice which he himself has
drawn up in direct contradiction to the interpretation of
the Poems given in his notes. Indeed I hardly knew
poor Omar was so far gone till his apologist informed
me. For here we see that, whatever were the wine that
Hafiz drank and sang, the veritable juice of the grape it
was which Omar used, not only when carousing with his
friends, but (says M. Nicolas) in order to excite himself
to that pitch of devotion which others reached by cries
and «hurlemens.» And yet, whenever wine, wine-bearer,
etc., occur in the text&mdash;which is often enough&mdash;M. Nicolas
carefully annotates «<i>Dieu</i>,» «<i>La Divinité</i>,» etc.: so carefully
indeed that one is tempted to think that he was indoctrinated
by the Sufi with whom he read the Poems.
A Persian would naturally wish to vindicate a distinguished
countryman: and a Sufi to enrol him in his
own sect, which already comprises all the chief poets in
Persia.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span></p>

<p>What historical authority has M. Nicolas to show that
Omar gave himself up «<i>avec passion à l'étude de la philosophie
des Soufis</i>»? The doctrines of Pantheism, Materialism,
Necessity, etc., were not peculiar to the Sufi; nor
to Lucretius before them; nor to Epicurus before him;
probably the very original irreligion of thinking men from
the first; and very likely to be the spontaneous growth
of a philosopher living in an age of social and political
barbarism, under shadow of one of the Two-and-Seventy
Religions supposed to divide the world. Von Hammer
(according to Sprenger's «Oriental Catalogue») speaks of
Omar as «a Free-thinker and <i>a great opponent of Sufism</i>»;
perhaps because, while holding much of their doctrine,
he would not pretend to any inconsistent severity of
morals. Sir W. Ouseley has written a note to something
of the same effect on the fly-leaf of the Bodleian MS.
And in two Rubaiyat of M. Nicolas' own Edition Suf
and Sufi are both disparagingly named.</p>

<p>No doubt many of these Quatrains seem unaccountable
unless mystically interpreted; but many more as unaccountable
unless literally. Were the Wine spiritual, for
instance, how wash the Body with it when dead? Why
make cups of the dead clay to be filled with&mdash;«<i>La Divinité</i>»&mdash;by
some succeeding Mystic? M. Nicolas himself
is puzzled by some «<i>bizarres</i>» and «<i>trop Orientales</i>»
allusions and images&mdash;«<i>d'une sensualité quelquefois révoltante</i>»
indeed&mdash;which «<i>les convenances</i>» do not permit
him to translate; but still which the reader cannot but
refer to «<i>La Divinité</i>».<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> No doubt also many of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
Quatrains in the Teheran, as in the Calcutta, Copies, are
spurious; such <i>Rubaiyat</i> being the common form of epigram
in Persia. But this, at best, tells as much one
way as another; nay, the Sufi, who may be considered
the scholar and man of letters in Persia, would be far
more likely than the careless epicure to interpolate what
favours his own view of the poet. I observe that very
few of the more mystical Quatrains are in the Bodleian
MS. which must be one of the oldest, as dated at Shiraz,
<span class="smcap">a.h.</span> 865, <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1460. And this, I think, especially distinguishes
Omar (I cannot help calling him by his&mdash;no,
not Christian&mdash;familar name) from all other Persian
poets: That, whereas with them the poet is lost in his
song, the man in allegory and abstraction, we seem to
have the man&mdash;the <i>bonhomme</i>&mdash;Omar himself, with all
his humours and passions, as frankly before us as if we
were really at table with him, after the wine had gone
round.</p>

<p>I must say that I, for one, never wholly believed in
the mysticism of Hafiz. It does not appear there was
any danger in holding and singing Sufi Pantheism, so
long as the poet made his salaam to Mohammed at the
beginning and end of his song. Under such conditions
Jelaluddin, Jami, Attar, and others sang; using wine
and beauty indeed as images to illustrate, not as a mask
to hide, the Divinity they were celebrating. Perhaps
some allegory less liable to mistake or abuse had been
better among so inflammable a people: much more so
when, as some think with Hafiz and Omar, the abstract
is not only likened to, but identified with, the sensual
Image; hazardous, if not to the devotee himself, yet to
his weaker brethren; and worse for the profane in proportion
as the devotion of the initiated grew warmer.
And all for what? To be tantalized with images of
sensual enjoyment which must be renounced if one would
approximate a God, who according to the doctrine, <i>is</i>
sensual matter as well as spirit, and into whose universe
one expects unconsciously to merge after death, without
hope of any posthumous beatitude in another world to
compensate for all one's self-denial in this. Lucretius'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
blind Divinity certainly merited, and probably got, as
much self-sacrifice as this of the Sufi; and the burden of
Omar's song&mdash;if not «Let us eat»&mdash;is assuredly&mdash;«Let
us drink, for to-morrow we die!» And if Hafiz meant
quite otherwise by a similar language, he surely miscalculated
when he devoted his life and genius to so
equivocal a psalmody as, from his day to this, has been
said and sung by any rather than spiritual worshippers.</p>

<p>However, as there is some traditional presumption,
and certainly the opinion of some learned men, in favour
of Omar's being a Sufi&mdash;and even something of a saint&mdash;those
who please may so interpret his wine and cup-bearer.
On the other hand, as there is far more historical
certainty of his being a philosopher, of scientific
insight and ability far beyond that of the age and country
he lived in; of such moderate worldly ambition as becomes
a philosopher, and such moderate wants as rarely
satisfy a debauchee. Other readers may be content to
believe with me that, while the wine Omar celebrates
is simply the juice of the grape, he bragged more than
he drank of it, in very defiance perhaps of that spiritual
wine which left its votaries sunk in hypocrisy or disgust.</p>

<p>(Stanza <span class="smcap">II</span>.) The «<i>False Dawn</i>»; <i>Subhi kazib</i>, a transient Light
on the Horizon about an hour before the <i>Subhi sadik</i>, or True Dawn;
a well-known Phenomenon in the East.</p>

<p>(<span class="smcap">IV</span>.) New Year. Beginning with the Vernal Equinox, it must be
remembered; and (howsoever the old Solar Year is practically superseded
by the clumsy <i>Lunar</i> Year that dates from the Mohammedan Hegira)
still commemorated by a Festival that is said to have been appointed
by the very Jamshyd whom Omar so often talks of, and whose yearly
Calendar he helped to rectify.</p>

<p>«The sudden approach and rapid advance of the Spring,» says
Mr. Binning,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> «are very striking. Before the Snow is well off the
Ground, the Trees burst into Blossom, and the Flowers start forth
from the Soil. At <i>Now Rooz</i> [<i>their</i> New Year's Day] the Snow was
lying in patches on the Hills and in the shaded Valleys, while the
Fruit-trees in the Gardens were budding beautifully, and green Plants
and Flowers springing up on the Plains on every side&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8249;And on old Hyems' Chin and icy Crown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An odorous Chaplet of sweet Summer buds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is, as in mockery, set&#8250;&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Among the Plants newly appeared I recognised some old Acquaintances
I had not seen for many a Year: among these, two varieties
of the Thistle&mdash;a coarse species of Daisy like the &#8249;Horse-gowan&#8250;&mdash;red
and white Clover&mdash;the Dock&mdash;the blue Corn-flower&mdash;and that
vulgar Herb the Dandelion rearing its yellow crest on the Banks of
the Water-courses.» The Nightingale was not yet heard, for the Rose
was not yet blown; but an almost identical Blackbird and Wood-pecker
helped to make up something of a North-country Spring.</p>

<p>«The White Hand of Moses.» Exodus iv. 6; where Moses draws
forth his Hand&mdash;not, according to the Persians, «<i>leprous as Snow,</i>»
&mdash;but <i>white</i>, as our May-blossom in Spring perhaps. According to
them also the Healing Power of Jesus resided in His Breath.</p>

<p>(<span class="smcap">V</span>.) Iram, planted by King Shaddad, and now sunk somewhere
in the Sands of Arabia. Jamshyd's Seven-ring'd Cup was typical of
the 7 Heavens, 7 Planets, 7 Seas, etc., and was a <i>Divining Cup</i>.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span></p>

<p>(<span class="smcap">VI</span>.) <i>Pehlevi</i>, the old Heroic <i>Sanskrit</i> of Persia. Hafiz also speaks
of the Nightingale's <i>Pehlevi</i>, which did not change with the People's.</p>

<p>I am not sure if the fourth line refers to the Red Rose looking
sickly, or to the Yellow Rose that ought to be Red; Red, White, and
Yellow Roses all common in Persia. I think that Southey in his
«Common-Place Book,» quotes from some Spanish author about the
Rose being White till 10 o'clock; «<i>Rosa Perfecta</i>» at 2; and «<i>perfecta
incarnada</i>» at 5.</p>

<p>(<span class="smcap">X</span>.) Rustum, the «Hercules» of Persia, and Zal his Father,
whose exploits are among the most celebrated in the Shahnama.
Hatim Tai, a well-known type of Oriental generosity.</p>

<p>(<span class="smcap">XIII</span>.) A Drum&mdash;beaten outside a Palace.</p>

<p>(<span class="smcap">XIV</span>.) That is, the Rose's Golden Centre.</p>

<p>(<span class="smcap">XVIII</span>.) Persepolis: call'd also <i>Takht.i-Jamshyd</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Throne
of Jamshyd</span>, «<i>King Splendid,</i>» of the mythical <i>Peshdadian</i> Dynasty,
and supposed (according to the Shahnama) to have been founded
and built by him. Others refer it to the Work of the Genie King,
Jan Ibn Jan&mdash;who also built the Pyramids&mdash;before the time of Adam.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bahram Gur</span>&mdash;<i>Bahram of the Wild Ass</i>&mdash;a Sassanian Sovereign&mdash;had
also his Seven Castles (like the King of Bohemia!) each
of a different Colour; each with a Royal Mistress within; each of
whom tells him a Story, as told in one of the most famous Poems of
Persia, written by Amir Khusraw: all these Seven also figuring (according
to Eastern Mysticism) the Seven Heavens; and perhaps the
Book itself that Eighth, into which the mystical Seven transcend, and
within which they revolve. The Ruins of Three of those Towers
are yet shown by the Peasantry; as also the swamp in which Bahram
sunk like the Master of Ravenswood while pursuing his <i>Gur</i>.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The Palace that to Heav'n his pillars threw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Kings the forehead on his threshold drew&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw the solitary Ringdove there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And «Coo, coo, coo,» she cried; and «Coo, coo, coo.»<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This Quatrain Mr. Binning found, among several of Hafiz and
others, inscribed by some stray hand among the ruins of Persepolis.
The Ringdove's ancient <i>Pehlevi Coo, Coo, Coo</i>, signifies also in Persian,
«<i>Where? Where? Where?</i>» In Attar's «Bird-parliament» she
is reproved by the Leader of the Birds for sitting still, and for ever
harping on that one note of lamentation for her lost Yusuf.</p>

<p>Apropos of Omar's Red Roses in Stanza xix., I am reminded of
an old English superstition, that our Anemone Pulsatilla, or purple
«Pasque Flower» (which grows plentifully about the Fleam Dyke,
near Cambridge), grows only where Danish blood has been spilt.</p>

<p>(<span class="smcap">XXI</span>.) A thousand years to each Planet.</p>

<p>(<span class="smcap">XXXI</span>.) Saturn, Lord of the Seventh Heaven.</p>

<p>(<span class="smcap">XXXII</span>.) <span class="smcap">Me-and-Thee</span>: some dividual Existence or Personality
distinct from the Whole.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span></p>

<p>(<span class="smcap">XXXVII</span>.) One of the Persian Poets&mdash;Attar, I think&mdash;has a pretty
story about this. A thirsty Traveller dips his hand into a Spring
of Water to drink from. By and by comes another who draws up
and drinks from an earthen Bowl, and then departs, leaving his Bowl
behind him. The first Traveller takes it up for another draught; but
is surprised to find that the same Water which had tasted sweet
from his own hand tastes bitter from the earthen Bowl. But a Voice&mdash;from
Heaven, I think&mdash;tells him the clay from which the Bowl is
made was once <i>Man</i>; and, into whatever shape renewed, can never
lose the bitter flavour of Mortality.</p>

<p>(<span class="smcap">XXXIX</span>.) The custom of throwing a little Wine on the ground before
drinking still continues in Persia, and perhaps generally in the
East. Mons. Nicolas considers it «<i>un signe de libéralité, et en
même temps un avertissement que le buveur doit vider sa coupe
jusqu' à la dernière goutte</i>.» Is it not more likely an ancient Superstition;
a Libation to propitiate Earth, or make her an Accomplice in
the illicit Revel? Or, perhaps, to divert the Jealous Eye by some
sacrifice of superfluity, as with the Ancients of the West? With Omar
we see something more is signified; the precious Liquor is not lost,
but sinks into the ground to refresh the dust of some poor Wine-worshipper
foregone.</p>

<p>Thus Hafiz, copying Omar in so many ways: «When thou drinkest
Wine pour a draught on the ground. Wherefore fear the Sin
which brings to another Gain?»</p>

<p>(<span class="smcap">XLIII</span>.) According to one beautiful Oriental Legend, Azrael accomplishes
his mission by holding to the nostril an Apple from the
Tree of Life.</p>

<p>This and the two following Stanzas would have been withdrawn,
as somewhat <i>de trop</i>, from the Text, but for advice which I least
like to disregard.</p>

<p>(<span class="smcap">LI</span>.) Prom Mah to Mahi; from Fish to Moon.</p>

<p>(<span class="smcap">LVI</span>.) A Jest, of course, at his Studies. A curious mathematical
Quatrain of Omar's has been pointed out to me; the more curious
because almost exactly parallel'd by some Verses of Bishop Donne's,
that are quoted in Izaak Walton's Lives! Here is Omar: «You and
I are the image of a pair of compasses; though we have two heads
(sc. our <i>feet</i>) we have one body; when we have fixed the centre for
our circle, we bring our heads (sc. feet) together at the end.» Dr.
Donne:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">If we be two, we two are so<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As stiff twin-compasses are two;<br /></span>

<p>(<span class="smcap">LXXV</span>.) Parwin and Mushtari&mdash;The Pleiads and Jupiter.</p>

<p>(<span class="smcap">LXXXVII</span>.) This Relation of Pot and Potter to Man and his Maker
figures far and wide in the Literature of the World, from the time
of the Hebrew Prophets to the present; when it may finally take the
name of «Pot theism,» by which Mr. Carlyle ridiculed Sterling's
«Pantheism.» <i>My</i> Sheikh, whose knowledge flows in from all quarters,
writes to me&mdash;</p>

<p>«Apropos of old Omar's Pots, did I ever tell you the sentence I
found in Bishop Pearson on the Creed? &#8249;Thus are we wholly at the
disposal of His will, and our present and future condition framed and
ordered by His free, but wise and just, decrees. <i>Hath not the potter
power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto
honour, and another unto dishonour?</i> (Rom. ix. 21.) And can that
earth-artificer have a freer power over his <i>brother potsherd</i>
(both being made of the same metal), than God hath over him, who,
by the strange fecundity of His omnipotent power, first made the clay
out of nothing, and then him out of that?&#8250;»</p>

<p>And again&mdash;from a very different quarter&mdash;«I had to refer the
other day to Aristophanes, and came by chance on a curious Speaking-pot
story in the <i>Vespæ</i>, which I had quite forgotten.</p>

<h3 class="p6"><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h3>


<p>The object with which this volume has been compiled
has been to set at rest, once and for ever, the vexed
question of how far Edward FitzGerald's incomparable
poem may be regarded as a translation of the Persian
originals, how far as an adaptation, and how far as
an original work. In the Introduction to my recently
published translation of the Ouseley MS. in the Bodleian
Library at Oxford, and more particularly in the Essay
which terminates the second edition of that work, I have
dwelt at considerable length upon the history of Edward
FitzGerald's poem and the influences of various Oriental
works which are traceable in it. As it is doubtful whether
the present volume will reach the hands of, or at any rate be
critically considered by, any students of the poem who
have not already had access to my former work, I do not
think that it would be either expedient or useful to repeat
in this place the information which is collected there,
but a short history of the major portion of Edward FitzGerald's
material is necessary, for the purpose of showing
why this question of translation, adaptation, or original
composition should have been a question open to lengthy
argument, and why it has been impossible to set it at
rest until the present time, when forty years have elapsed
since first Edward FitzGerald's poem attracted the attention
of those great scholars and poets who rescued it, as
recounted in the threadbare anecdote, from the oblivion
of the penny box.</p>

<p>The influence of the Ouseley MS. upon the poem forms
the subject of the volume to which I have referred, and,
save in so far as it recurs in the parallels which give excuse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
for the present work, may be dismissed, but the
doubts which have sprung up as to the extent to which
Edward FitzGerald took, as his editor, Mr. Aldis Wright,
says, «great liberties with the original,» have arisen in
consequence of the vicissitudes which have befallen the
rest of the material from which the poet worked during
the construction of his first edition. We know that Prof.
Cowell made a copy of the Ouseley MS. for Edward
FitzGerald just before he went to India in August, 1856.
In another letter he says «I got a copy made for him
from the one MS. in the Bengal Asiatic Society's Library
at Calcutta soon after I arrived in November, 1856. It
reached FitzGerald June 14th, 1857, as I learn by a note
in his writing. Some time after this I sent him a copy
of that rare Calcutta printed edition which I got from my
Munshi.» To possess oneself therefore of full information
as to what material Edward FitzGerald really worked
from in making the original edition of his poem, it was
necessary to consult, line by line, and word by word, the
Calcutta MS. (noted as No. 1548 in the Bengal Asiatic
Society's Library) and the Calcutta <i>printed</i> edition of 1836,&mdash;in
addition, of course, to the Ouseley MS. Prof. Cowell
most generously placed at my disposal his copy of the
Calcutta MS., but, as he himself has recorded, the copy
was made by an inferior scribe in a hand which is exceedingly
difficult to read. I therefore communicated
with Mr. A.T. Pringle, Director of Indian Records in
the Home Department at Calcutta, himself a keen and
critical student of Omar Khayyam, with a view to getting
either a photographic reproduction, or a clean copy of
this MS. made for me. Careful search and widely spread
enquiry brought to light the fact that the MS. was lost,
stolen, or strayed, so that Prof. Cowell's copy was the
only record left of this portion of Edward FitzGerald's
material. This copy I sent out to India, and had copied
by a good writer, a copy being made at the same time to
replace that which had been stolen.</p>

<p>I next addressed myself to the discovery of «that rare
Calcutta <i>printed</i> edition,» of whose existence, after searching
in vain every European State library and many others,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
and every library in India of which I could learn, I began
to have grave doubts, thinking that Prof. Cowell had
inadvertently confused it with an edition <i>lithographed</i>
simultaneously at Calcutta and Teheran in 1836. In the
summer, however, when I had given up all hope, one of
Mr. Pringle's clerks picked up a copy of the long sought
book in the Bazar at Calcutta, printed from type at Calcutta
in 1836. A circumstance that greatly adds to the
interest of this discovery, whilst at the same time it very
greatly lessened my labours, lies in the fact that this edition
is evidently printed from the lost Calcutta MS. itself,
both introduction and quatrains being identical in readings
and sequence. A few quatrains, including the repetitions,
forming part of the MS. and nearly all those
written in the margins of the MS. are omitted, but nearly
all of these are added as an appendix to the book, the
printer explaining in a short note that they were found
in a <i>bayaz</i> (or book of extracts), and were added in that
place instead of in their <i>diwan</i> (or alphabetical) order on
account of their more than ordinarily antinomian tendency.
A very interesting question arises hereon, whether these
latter were printed into the book from the margins of the
MS. after being purposely or accidentally omitted, <i>or</i>
whether they were written on to the margin of the MS.
from this book at some date between 1836 and 1856. I
think that the former is the more likely explanation, but
in the absence of the MS. this question cannot be solved.</p>

<p>I find myself therefore in the interesting position of
having the whole of FitzGerald's material before me;
and though (so perfectly did Edward FitzGerald identify
himself with his author's habit of mind) many other
MSS. contain quatrains that closely resemble his marvellous
paraphrase, there is nothing written by or attributed
to Omar Khayyam which served FitzGerald for inspiration
in making his first edition, other than what is to be
found in the three, or rather two, texts above referred
to. I have spoken already (and at length, in the Terminal
Essay to my former volume) of the influences exerted
by other Oriental poets upon his work, and especially
that of the Mantik ut-tair, or Parliament of Birds of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
Ferid ud din Attar; where it was direct or exclusive I
have set it down in the parallels which follow. The result
of my observations may be summarised as follows:</p>

<p>Of Edward FitzGerald's quatrains, forty-nine are faithful
and beautiful paraphrases of single quatrains to be
found in the Ouseley or Calcutta MSS., or both.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>Forty-four are traceable to more than one quatrain,
and therefore may be termed «composite» quatrains.</p>

<p>Two are inspired by quatrains found by FitzGerald
only in Nicolas' text.</p>

<p>Two are quatrains reflecting the whole spirit of the
original poem.</p>

<p>Two are traceable exclusively to the influence of the
Mantik ut-tair of Ferid ud din Attar.</p>

<p>Two quatrains primarily inspired by Omar were influenced
by the Odes of Hafiz.</p>

<p>And three, which appeared only in the first and second
editions and were afterwards suppressed by Edward FitzGerald
himself, are not&mdash;so far as a careful search
enables me to judge&mdash;attributable to any lines of the
original texts. Other authors may have inspired them,
but their identification is not useful in this case.</p>

<p>The «fillip,» so to speak, given to FitzGerald's interest
in the ruba'iyat, by the publication of Monsieur J.B.
Nicolas' text and translation of 464 «<i>Les Quatrains de
Khèyam</i>» (Paris, 1867), must not be lost sight of, and
may be held responsible for many, if not most of the
variations and additions that differentiate the second,
third, and fourth editions from the first. This volume,
as FitzGerald himself records in his Introduction to the
second and subsequent editions, «reminded him of several
things and instructed him in others.» Two of FitzGerald's
later quatrains at least (Nos. 46 and 98) come from that
text, and these I have never seen in any MS. text; and,
in seeking the parallels to the present volume, I have
collated exactly 5,235 ruba'iyat in the original Persian.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
I have appended to every Persian ruba'i in the following
pages, references to the texts in which I have found the
same ruba'i, in the identical form, or more or less varied,
and it will be observed that, for the most part, the
ruba'iyat which inspired FitzGerald are those which have
so appealed to the Oriental mind as to be represented in
nearly all the MSS. and texts under examination. The
Ouseley MS. being the first text that occupied FitzGerald's
attention, where his inspirational lines occur
both in that MS. and the Calcutta MS., I have given the
Ouseley MS. version, noting any important variations to
be found in the Calcutta MS. It will be observed that
FitzGerald's tendency, after the second edition, was to
eliminate quatrains which were merely suggested by the
general tone and sentiment of the original poem, and
not the reflection or translation of particular and identifiable
ruba'iyat. The reader is especially recommended,
when studying these parallels, to turn to the corresponding
quatrain in the first edition, for FitzGerald often
diverged further from the originals in making his subsequent
variations&mdash;notably, for instance, in the first and
forty-eighth quatrains.</p>

<p>With regard to my own translations of the originals in
the following pages, I may remark that the excessive
baldness of the translation is intentional, for I deemed it
better to put before the lovers of FitzGerald's poem the
closest and most unpolished English rendering, rather
than to attempt to clothe the literal meaning of the originals
in graceful phraseology.</p>

<p>I desire to record in this place my most cordial thanks,
for the invaluable assistance they have given me in the
preparation of this volume, to Mr. A.T. Pringle, Professor
E.B. Cowell, and Dr. E. Denison Ross, and to Mr. Aldis
Wright, Edward FitzGerald's literary executor, and his
publishers Messrs. Macmillan, for their very kind permission
to reproduce in this volume the poem which has
brought it into existence.</p>

<span class="i0">Wake! For the Sun, who scatter'd into flight<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The Sultan's Turret with a Shaft of Light.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This version of the opening quatrain is gradually
evolved through the four editions. The quatrain, which,
in the first edition runs:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Awake! for Morning in the Bowl of Night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has flung the Stone that puts the Stars to Flight:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lo! the Hunter of the East has caught<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Sultan's Turret in a Noose of Light.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>is inspired by C. 134.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The Sun casts the noose of morning upon the roofs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kai Khosru of the day, he throws a stone into the bowl:<br /></span>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span></p>
<p>It is not surprising that Mr. Aldis Wright, in his editorial
note at the end of Messrs. Macmillan's definitive
edition (London, 1890), states that «the first stanza is
entirely his own,» for, in this precise form the ruba'i is
only to be found in the Calcutta MS. and in a recently
discovered MS. copied largely from it and belonging to
the Nawab of Tonk. The matter rests upon the word
«stone» in the second line. The word means «to fling a
stone into a cup or pot,» which is the signal for «striking
camp» among tribes of nomad Arabs. All the other
texts I have seen read wine for stone which has made
the translators (Whinfield and Payne) properly render the
passage «pours <i>wine</i> into the cup.»</p>

<p>The inspiration for this quatrain is to be found in C. 5:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>In FitzGerald's quatrain there is traceable the influence
of one of the odes of Hafiz, translated by Prof. Cowell
(in «Fraser's Magazine,» September, 1854), which he
greatly admired. The lines in question run:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The morning dawns and the cloud has woven a canopy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The morning draught, my friends, the morning draught!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is strange that at such a season<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They shut up the wine tavern! Oh, hasten!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have they still shut up the door of the tavern?<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>The influence of these lines is carried on into the next
quatrain.</p>


<p class="center"><a name="FITZ5III" id="FITZ5III"></a>III.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And, as the Cock crew, those who stood before<br /></span>

<span class="i0">You know how little while we have to stay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, once departed, may return no more.»<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The inspiration for this quatrain is found in four

273, 247.</p>

<p>This is a very composite quatrain, which cannot be
claimed as a translation of all, or the main part of any,
of the C. or O. quatrains. All the texts, as indeed all
Persian poetry, are filled with references of which we
find an echo here. In the authorities at our disposal,
Jamshyd is referred to in C. 254. The Ruby in the Wine
occurs in O. 39, 87, 149, and in C. 296, 304, 413, and 460.
The Garden by the Water occurs in O. 151 (C. 415), and
in C. 44 and 417. I have never found any reference
to the Garden of Iram in quatrains attributed to Omar
Khayyam.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>This is the quatrain (not No. 31 as stated by Mr. Aldis

and is as follows:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">An observer of spiritual things approached the sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And said «O sea, why are you blue?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">There is no fire, why do you boil?»<br /></span>

<span class="i0">«I weep for my separation from the Friend,<br /></span>

<p>That Edward FitzGerald was not following any particular
ruba'iyat of the original MSS. is clearly indicated
by the great variation observable in the forms that this
quatrain successively assumed in the first, second and
third editions. It suggests an exposition of the Sufi doctrine
of the emanation of the mortal Creature from God
the Creator, and his reabsorption into God. There is a
quatrain in L. (No. 641) and in B. ii. (No. 457) which
is akin to it, but FitzGerald was not acquainted with
these texts. (It is No. 400 in W.) I have no doubt that
FitzGerald's 34th quatrain was suggested to him by two
intricate passages in the Mantik ut-tair, commencing respectively
at distich 3090 and distich 3735. The first of
these may be translated:</p>

<p>«The Creator of the World spoke thus to David from
behind the Curtain of the Secret: &#8249;For everything in the
world, good or bad, visible or invisible, thou canst find
a substitute, but for Me, thou canst find neither substitute
nor equal. Since nothing can be substituted for Me,
do not cease to abide in Me. I am thy Soul, destroy
not thou thy Soul, I am necessary to thee, O thou my
servant. Seek not to exist apart from Me.&#8250;»</p>

<p>The second passage reads: «Since long ago, really, I
am thee, and thou art Me, we two are but One. Art
thou Me, or am I thee? is there any duality in the
matter? Either I am thee, or thou art Me, or thou,
thou art thyself. Since thou art Me and I am thee for
ever, our two bodies are One: Salutation!»</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span></p>

<p>This quatrain, which is in the nature of a reflection
upon the three preceding ones, conveys an idea which is
constantly recurrent in the ruba'iyat. Edward FitzGerald
himself records, in a note, that, in composing this quatrain,
he had in mind a very beautiful story in the Mantik
ut-tair of the water of a certain well which, ordinarily
sweet, became bitter when drawn in a vessel made from
clay which once had been a man. For its inclusion in this
poem FitzGerald had the support of two (among many)
quatrains from C. 475 and 488.</p>

the same idea.</p>

<p>This is a very composite quatrain, round which some
controversy has raged. Professor Cowell has given the
weight of his authority to the statement that «there is
no original for the line about the snake.» This is true
in so far as that the image does not occur in Omar, but
FitzGerald had seen it in an important apologue in the
Mantik ut-tair (beginning at distich 3229) in which
we read of the presence of the Snake (Iblis) in Paradise,
at the moment of the creation of Adam, and in the
course of which, Satan himself addresses God thus:</p>

<span class="i0">There must be poison, everything is not antidote.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>FitzGerald constructed these three quatrains from O. 103.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I went last night into the workshop of a potter,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw two thousand pots, some speaking, and some silent;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Suddenly one of the pots cried out aggressively:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">«Where are the pot-maker, and the pot-buyer, and the pot-seller?»<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It will be observed that the reading of quatrain 87, l. 4,
in the third edition of FitzGerald is close to this original.
«Who makes&mdash;Who buys&mdash;Who sells&mdash;Who is the Pot?»</p>

<p>«Hunger stricken Ramazan» is described in C. 198.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They say that the moon of Ramazan<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> shines out again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Henceforth one cannot linger over the wine;<br /></span>

<p>This quatrain is a perfect reflection and companion of
all these Kuza Nama quatrains, but I have not found a
ruba'i in O. or C. which can be pointed out as having
directly inspired<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> it. It must, I think, be considered

<p>In addition to the quatrains composing the final form
in which we know his poem, there are a few stray
quatrains scattered about Edward FitzGerald's Introduction
and Notes. There are also two quatrains which appeared
in the first edition only, and nine that appeared in the
second edition only. I do not think that this work would
be complete without an attempt to identify these quatrains
in the original texts which inspired them.</p>

<p>In the first edition we find quatrain No. 33, which,
like its distant cousin in the fourth edition (No. 34),
appears to have no near parallel in the texts. No. 45
is a quatrain in a like predicament, and it may be for
this reason that FitzGerald dropped it out of all subsequent
editions.</p>

<p>The only other quatrain peculiar to the first edition
is No. 37. This would appear to have been inspired by
ll. 3 and 4 of O. 20, quoted in the parallels to quatrain
No. 57 and by O. 17, ll. 3 and 4.</p>

<p>It must be admitted that FitzGerald took great liberties with the
original in his version of Omar Khayyam. The first stanza is entirely
his own, and in stanza <span class="smcap">XXXI</span>. of the fourth edition (<span class="smcap">XXXVI</span>. in the second)
he has introduced two lines from Attar. (See «Letters,» p. 251.)
In stanza <span class="smcap">LXXXI</span>. (fourth edition), writes Professor Cowell, «There is
no original for the line about the snake: I have looked for it in vain
in Nicolas; but I have always supposed that the last line is FitzGerald's
mistaken version of Quatr. 236 in Nicolas's ed. which runs
thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">«O thou who knowest the secrets of every one's mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who graspest every one's hand in the hour of weakness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O God, give me repentance and accept my excuses,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O thou who givest repentance and acceptest the excuses of every one.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>«FitzGerald mistook the meaning of <i>giving</i> and <i>accepting</i> as
used here, and so invented his last line out of his own mistake. I
wrote to him about it when I was in Calcutta; but he never cared
to alter it.»</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span></p>

<p>Omar is a poet who can hardly be translated satisfactorily
otherwise than in verse. Prose does well
enough for narrative or didactic poetry, where the
main things to be reproduced are the matter and substance,
but it is plainly contra-indicated in the case of
poetry like Omar's, where the matter is little else than
«the commonplaces of the lyric ode and the tragic
chorus,» and where nearly the whole charm consists in
the style and the manner, the grace of the expression
and the melody of the versification. A literal prose version
of such poetry must needs be unsatisfactory, because
it studiously ignores the chief points in which the attractiveness
of the original consists, and deliberately
renounces all attempt to reproduce them.</p>

<p>In deciding on the form to be taken by a new translation
of Omar, the fact of the existence of a previous
verse translation of universally acknowledged merit ought
not, of course, to be left out of account. The successor
of a translator like Mr. Fitzgerald, who ventures to write
verse, and especially verse of the metre which he has
handled with such success, cannot help feeling at almost
every step that he is provoking comparisons very much
to his own disadvantage. But I do not think this consideration
ought to deter him from using the vehicle
which everything else indicates as the proper one.</p>

<p>As regards metre, there is no doubt that the quatrain
of ten-syllable lines which has been tried by Hammer,
Bicknell, and others, and has been raised by Mr. Fitzgerald
almost to the rank of a recognised English metre,
is the best representative of the <i>Ruba'i</i>. It fairly satisfies
Conington's canon, viz., that there ought to be some
degree of metrical conformity between the measure of
the original and the translation, for though it does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
exactly correspond with the <i>Ruba'i</i>, it very clearly suggests
it. In particular, it copies what is perhaps the most
marked feature of the <i>Ruba'i</i>,&mdash;the interlinking of the
four lines by the repetition in the fourth line of the rhyme
of the first and second. Mr Swinburne's modification of
this metre, in which the rhyme is carried on from one
quatrain to the next, is not applicable to poems like
Omar's, all of which are isolated in sense from the context.
Alexandrines would, of course, correspond more nearly
than decasyllables with <i>Ruba'i</i> lines in number of syllables,
and they have been extensively used by Bodenstedt
and other German translators of the metre but, whatever
may be the case in German, they are apt to read very
heavily in English, even when constructed by skilful
verse-makers, and an inferior workman can hardly hope
to manage them with anything like success. The shorter
length of the decasyllable line is not altogether a disadvantage
to the translator. Owing to the large number
of monosyllables in English, it is generally adequate to
hold the contents of a Persian line a syllable or two
longer; and a line erring, if at all, on the side of brevity,
has at any rate the advantage of obliging the translator
to eschew modern diffuseness, and of making him try to
copy the «classical parsimony,» the archaic terseness and
condensation of the original.</p>

<p>The poet Cowper has a remark on translation from Latin
which is eminently true also of translation from Persian.
He says, «That is epigrammatic and witty in Latin which
would be perfectly insipid in English.... If a
Latin poem is neat, elegant, and musical, it is enough,
but English readers are not so easily satisfied.» Much
of Omar's matter, when literally translated, seems very
trite and commonplace, many of the «conceits,» of which
he is so fond, very frigid, and even his peculiar grotesque
humour often loses its savour in an English <i>replica</i>. The
translator is often tempted to elevate a too grovelling
sentiment, to «sharpen a point» here and there, to trick
out a commonplace with some borrowed modern embellishment.
But this temptation is one to be resisted as far
as possible. According to the <i>Hadis</i>, «The business of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
messenger is simply to deliver his message,» and he must
not shrink from displaying the naked truth. A translator
who writes in verse must of course claim the liberty of
altering the form of the expression over and over again,
but the substituted expressions ought to be in keeping
with the author's style, and on the same plane of sentiment
as his. It is beyond the province of a translator to attempt
the task of «painting the lily.» But it is easier
to lay down correct principles of translation than to observe
them unswervingly in one's practice.</p>

<p>As regards subject matter, Omar's quatrains may be
classed under the following six heads:&mdash;</p>

<p>I. <i>Shikayat i rozgar</i>&mdash;Complaints of «the wheel of
heaven,» or fate, of the world's injustice, of the loss of
friends, of man's limited faculties and destinies.</p>

<p>II. <i>Hajw</i>&mdash;Satires on the hypocrisy of the «unco'
guid,» the impiety of the pious, the ignorance of the
learned, and the untowardness of his own generation.</p>

<p>III. <i>Firakiya</i> and <i>Wisaliya</i>&mdash;Love-poems on the sorrows
of separation and the joys of reunion with the
Beloved, earthly or spiritual.</p>

<p>IV. <i>Bahariya</i>&mdash;Poems in praise of spring, gardens, and
flowers.</p>

<p>V. <i>Kufriya</i>&mdash;Irreligious and antinomian utterances,
charging the sins of the creature to the account of the
Creator, scoffing at the Prophet's Paradise and Hell, singing
the praises of wine and pleasure&mdash;preaching <i>ad
nauseam</i>, «eat and drink (especially drink), for to-morrow
ye die.»</p>

<p>VI. <i>Munajat</i>&mdash;Addresses to the Deity, now in the
ordinary language of devotion, bewailing sins and imploring
pardon, now in Mystic phraseology, craving
deliverance from «self,» and union with the «Truth»
(<i>Al Hakk</i>), or Deity, as conceived by the Mystics.</p>

<p>The «complaints» may obviously be connected with
the known facts of the poet's life, by supposing them
to have been prompted by the persecution to which he
was subjected on account of his opinions. His remarks
on the Houris and other sacred subjects raised such a
feeling against him that at one time his life was in danger,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
and the wonder is that he escaped at all in a city like
Naishapur, where the <i>odium theologicum</i> raged so fiercely
as to occasion a sanguinary civil war. In the year 489
<span class="smcap">a.h.</span>, as we learn from Ibn Al Athir,<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> the orthodox
banded themselves together under the leadership of Abul
Kasim and Muhammad, the chiefs of the Hanefites and
the Shafeites, in order to exterminate the Kerramians
or Anthropomorphist heretics, and succeeded in putting
many of them to death, and destroying all their establishments.
It may be also that after the death of his
patron, Nizam ul Mulk, Omar lost his stipend and was
reduced to poverty.</p>

<p>The satires probably owed their origin to the same
cause. <i>Rien soulage comme la rhetorique</i>, and if Omar
could not relieve his feelings by open abuse of his persecutors,
he made up for it by the bitterness of his verses.
The bitterness of his strictures on them was no doubt
fully equalled by the rancour of their attacks upon him.</p>

<p>The love-poems are samples of a class of compositions
much commoner in later poets than in Omar. Most of
them probably bear a mystical meaning, for I doubt if
Omar was a person very susceptible of the tender passion.
He speaks with appreciation of «tulip cheeks» and «cypress
forms,» but apparently recognises no attractions of
a higher order in his fair friends.</p>

<p>The poems in praise of scenery again offer a strong
contrast to modern treatment of the same theme. The
only aspects of nature noticed by Omar are such as affect
the senses agreeably&mdash;the bright flowers, the song of the
nightingale, the grassy bank of the stream, and the shady
garden associated in his mind with his convivial parties.
The geographer translated by Sir W. Ouseley says of
Naishapur, «The city is watered by a subterranean canal,
which is conveyed to the fields and gardens, and there is
a considerable stream that waters the city and the villages
about it&mdash;this stream is named <i>Saka</i>. In all the provinces
of Khorassan there is not any city larger than Naishapur,
nor any blessed with a more pure and temperate air» No<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
doubt it was some of these gardens that called forth
Omar's encomiums.</p>

<p>But it is in the <i>Kufriya</i>, or antinomian quatrains, and in
the <i>Munajat</i>, or pious aspirations, that the most remarkable
and characteristic features of Omar's poetry are exhibited.
The glaring contrast between these two classes
of his poetry has led his readers to take very opposite
views of him, according as they looked at one or the other
side of the shield. European critics, like his contemporaries,
mostly consider him an infidel and a voluptuary «of
like mind with Sardanapalus.» On the other hand, the
Sufis have contrived to affix mystical and devotional
meanings even to his most Epicurean quatrains; and this
method of interpretation is nowadays as universally accepted
in Persia and India as the Mystical interpretation
of the Canticles is in Europe. But neither of these views
can be accepted in its entirety. Even if the Sufi symbolism
had been definitely formulated as early as Omar's
time, which is very doubtful, common sense would forbid
us to force a devotional meaning on the palpably Epicurean
quatrains; and, on the other hand, unless we are
prepared to throw over the authority of all the manuscripts,
including the most ancient ones, we must reckon
with the obviously Mystical and devotional quatrains.
The essential contradiction in the tone and temper of
these two sections of Omar's poetry cannot be glossed
over, but calls imperatively for explanation.</p>

<p>His poems were obviously not all written at one period
of his life, but from time to time, just as circumstances
and mood suggested, and under the influence of the
thoughts, passions, and desires which happened to be uppermost
at the moment. It may be that the irreligious
and Epicurean quatrains were written in youth, and the
<i>Munajat</i> in his riper years. But this hypothesis seems
to be disproved by Sharastani's account of him, which is
quite silent as to any such conversion or change of sentiment
on his part, and also by the fact that he describes
himself from first to last as a «<i>Dipsychus</i>» in grain, a
halter between two opinions, and an <i>«Acrates</i>,» or back-slider,
in his practice.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span></p>

<p>If his poems be considered not in the abstract, but in
the light of history, taking into account his mental pedigree
and his intellectual surroundings, a more plausible explanation
of his inconsistencies readily presents itself. In
his youth, as we know, he sat at the feet of the Suni
theologian Imam Muaffik, and he was then no doubt thoroughly
indoctrinated with the great Semitic conception of
the One God, or, to use the expressive term of Muhammadan
theology, «the Only Real Agent» (<i>Fa' il i Hakiki</i>).
To minds dominated by the overwhelming sense of Almighty
Power, everywhere present and working, there
seems no room for Nature, or human will, or chance,
or any other Ahriman whatsoever, to take the responsibility
of all the evils in the world, the storms and the
earthquakes, the Borgias and the Catilines. The «Only
Real Agent» has to answer for all. In the most ancient
document of Semitic religious speculation now extant, the
Book of Job, we find expostulations of the boldest character
addressed to the Deity for permitting a righteous
man to be stricken with unmerited misfortunes, though
the writer ultimately concludes in a spirit of pious agnosticism
and resignation to the inscrutable dispensations of
Providence. In the Book of Ecclesiastes again, the same
problems are handled, but in a somewhat different temper.
The «weary king Ecclesiast» remarks that there is one
event to all, to him that sacrificeth and him that sacrificeth
not&mdash;that injustice and wrong seem eternally triumphant,
that God has made things crooked, and none can make
them straight; and concludes now in favour of a sober
«<i>carpe diem</i>» philosophy, now in favour of a devout «fear
of the Lord.» Of course the manner in which the serious
Hebrew handles these matters is very different from
the levity and flippancy of the volatile Persian, but it can
hardly be denied that the Ecclesiast and Omar resemble
one another in the double and contradictory nature of their
practical conclusions.</p>

<p>No sooner was Islam established than the same problem
of the existence of evil in the handiwork of the Almighty
Author and Governor of all began to trouble the Moslem
theologians, and by their elaboration of the doctrine of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
Predestination they managed to aggravate its difficulties.</p>

<p>One of the chief «roots» of their discussions was how to
reconcile the Divine justice and benevolence with the
Divine prescience,&mdash;the predestination of some vessels to
honour, and others to dishonour,&mdash;the pre-ordainment
of all things by a kind of mechanical necessity (<i>Jabr</i>),
leaving no possibility of the occurrence of any events
except those which actually do occur. The consideration
of one corollary of a similar doctrine moved the pious
and gentle Cowper to use language of indignant dissent;
and there is high theological authority for the view
that it is calculated «to thrust some into desperation,» but
to stimulate the piety of others. Omar is constantly dwelling
on this doctrine, and he seems to be affected by it in
the double way here mentioned.</p>

<p>Other influences which acted on Omar must not be left
out of account. Born as he was in Khorassan, «the focus
of Persian culture,» he was no doubt familiar with speculations
of the Moslem philosophers, Alkindi, Alfarabi, and
Avicenna,<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> the last of whom he may possibly have seen.
And though, think he was not himself a Sufi, in the
sense of being affiliated to any Sufi order, he can hardly
have been unaffected by the mysticism of which his predecessor
in <i>Ruba'i</i> writing, Abu Sa'id bin Abul Khair, his
patron Nizam ul Mulk, and his distinguished countryman
Imam Ghazali were all strong adherents. His philosophical
studies would naturally stimulate his sceptical and
irreligious dispositions, while his Mystic leanings would
operate mainly in the contrary direction.</p>

<p>If this explanation of the inconsistencies in his poetry
be correct, it is obvious that the parallel often sought to
be traced between him and Lucretius has no existence.
Whatever he was, he was not an Atheist. To him, as to
other Muhammadans of his time, to deny the existence
of the Deity would seem to be tantamount to denying the
existence of the world and of himself. And the conception
of «laws of nature» was also one quite foreign to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
habits of thought. As Deutsch says, «To a Shemite, Nature
is simply what has been begotten, and is ruled absolutely
by One Absolute Power.»</p>

<p>Hammer compares him to Voltaire, but in reality he is
a Voltaire and something more. He has much of Voltaire's
flippancy and irreverence. His treatment of the
doctrine of the Resurrection of the Body, for instance,
which Muhammad took from Christianity, and travestied
by the embellishments he added to it, is altogether in
Voltaire's manner. And his insistence on the all importance
of kindness and charity recalls the better side of
Voltaire's character, viz., his kindness to Calas, and the
other victims of ecclesiastical persecution. But Omar also
possessed, what Voltaire did not, strong religious emotions,
which at times overrode his rationalism, and found expression
in those devotional and Mystical quatrains, which
offer such a strong contrast to the rest of his poetry.</p>

<p>This grand old poet, who flourished in the 11th century
and who brought into Khorasan the delights of the
Court of the Seldjoukides, still, in our day, continues
to charm with the pleasures of the palace of the Kadjars
at Teheran. But the difficulty, on the one hand, of
translating a writer so essentially abstract in his philosophic
thought, so Mystically foreign in his figurative
expressions (too often presented in the form of a repulsive
materialism), and on the other, the embarrassment I could
foresee in the correcting of proofs at so great a distance
from Paris, and above all the feeling of my incapacity
for undertaking so great a work, always prevented my
publishing anything up to the present time.</p>

<p>On my last journey to Paris, I met some friends eager
for something new in the way of Oriental literature,
among whom I am pleased to mention Madam Blanchecotte,
moralist and poet, known through her many witty
and impassioned publications. After having listened to
the brief quotations which I was able to cite to them
from the quatrains of the poet with whom we are now
occupied, they so strongly urged me to publish a complete
translation, and put so much emphasis on their demand
and so much kindness in their offers of service, that I
decided to conform to their desires in editing this work
to-day.</p>

<p>I should, however, still have considered it beyond my
powers, without the co-operation of Hassan-Ali-Khan,
minister plenipotentiary from Persia at the Court of the
Tuileries, who put himself out to aid me with his profound
erudition and valuable advice.</p>

<p>The history of Khayyam, bound to that of two persons
who played a great rôle in the annals of the country,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
is, I believe, of sufficient interest to warrant my telling
it here as it has been transmitted to us by the Persian
historians.</p>

<p>Khayyam, born in a village situated near Nishapur,
in Khorasan, went to complete his studies at the celebrated
<i>medresseh</i> of that city, towards the end of the year 1042
of the Christian era. Accounts tell us that this college
had acquired at that time the reputation of producing
pupils of rare distinction, from among whom men of
talent and remarkable skill often sprung up and rapidly
attained to the highest positions in the empire.</p>

<p>Abdul-Kassem and Hassan-Sebbah, fellow-students with
Khayyam, were the two comrades to whom he was especially
attached, notwithstanding a divergence of character
and opinion which would seem to indicate in him
another choice. One day Khayyam asked his two friends,
in a jesting manner, if a compact entered into among
them, and based upon absolute necessity, for that one of
the three whom Fortune most favored to come to the aid
of the other two, heaping benefits upon them, would appear
to them a childish thing. «No, no,» answered
they, «the idea is excellent and we will adopt it with all
eagerness.» Immediately the three friends clasped hands
and vowed that when the time came they would be
faithful to their agreement. This pact but stimulated
the emulation of the three young people. They applied
themselves to their studies with more ardor even than
was demanded of them, since in accordance with the
tradition of the college, the high places belong to those
who merit them.</p>

<p>Khayyam, of a sweet and modest nature, was rather
given to the contemplation of divine things than to the
pleasures of worldly life. This tendency and the kind of
study he cultivated made of him a Mystic poet, a philosopher
at once skeptical and fatalistic, a Sufi&mdash;in a word,
what most Oriental poets are.</p>

<p>Abdul-Kassem, on the contrary, ambitious and positive
in the full acceptation of the word, anxious to come into
power, applied himself principally to the study of the
history of his country, which presented to him numerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
examples of celebrated men who, by their merit
and courage, had come into the highest offices, and
where, besides, he found excellent lessons in all branches
of administration. He became an illustrious statesman.
As for Hassan-Sebbah, as ambitious as his fellow-student
Abdul-Kassem, but less skilful, and more violent than
he in the application of means, artful and jealous of the
superiority of his comrades, he followed somewhere nearly
the same studies, holding ever to the purpose of serving
himself by the ruin of all those who dared to oppose his
advancement in the career he had chosen. He also became
celebrated, as will be shown farther on in this
preface, through the cruelties he committed and the blood
he spilled.</p>

<p>Their studies ended, the three friends left college and
separated to return to their own homes, where they remained
a certain length of time without renown. Abdul-Kassem,
however, was not long in making himself
advantageously known at the Court of Alp-Arslan, the
second king of the dynasty of the Seldjoukides, through
divers writings on the subject of administration, and
soon became the private secretary of that monarch, then
under-secretary of State, and finally Prime Minister.</p>

<p>Alp-Arslan, in putting this skilful administrator at
the head of affairs in his empire, conferred upon him
the honorary title of Nizam-el-Moulk, «Regulator of the
Empire,» a title which, among the Persians, replaces
the name of the person to whom it is granted. The
historians of that time write in eulogy of this great
man and, attributing to his virtues and his ability the
success and prosperity of Alp-Arslan's reign, hold in
profound admiration the discernment of that monarch,
who knew how to attach to himself a minister endowed
with so much skill in directing the affairs of his vast
Principalities, which attained, under his administration,
the highest degree of glory of which the Persian annals
make mention.</p>

<p>It was towards that epoch, where Nizam-el-Moulk (for
henceforth it is by this title that we shall designate
him) had arrived at the apogee of his power, that his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
two friends came to recall to him the contract concluded
amongst them. «What do you demand of me?»
he said to them.</p>

<p>«I only ask,» responded Khayyam, «that I may enjoy
the revenues of my native village. I am a Sufi
and not ambitious; if you accede to my request, I
could, under my paternal roof, far from the inseparable
fetters of the things of this world, cultivate poesy,
which delights my soul, and peaceably contemplate the
works of the Creator, which is acceptable to my mind.»</p>

<p>«As for me,» said Hassan-Sebbah, «I ask a place at
Court.»</p>

<p>The minister granted everything: the young poet returned
to his village, of which he became chief, and
Hassan-Sebbah took his place at Court, where, crafty
courtier that he was, he was not long in getting into
the good graces of the monarch. But, although he had
already acquired the highest distinction possible, thanks
to the effective aid of Nizam-el-Moulk, his envious and
zealous mind could not accommodate itself to the kind
of submission in which he found himself, face to face
with his benefactor. He immediately went to work to
overturn and supplant him.</p>

<p>To this end, he commenced to insinuate to Alp-Arslan
that the royal finances were not in good state, the minister
having neglected the collecting of taxes, and not having
rendered an account upon this important subject for
three years. The Prince gave ear to these treacherous
criticisms, and immediately Nizam-el-Moulk was sent
for to Court, where Alp-Arslan asked him, in presence
of all the great dignitaries, called together for this purpose,
for a complete account of uncollected taxes and
a definite statement of all finances of State. Nizam-el-Moulk
excused himself as best he could for the delay
of which his Majesty complained, on the ground of certain
circumstances beyond his control, and promised to occupy
himself seriously with the question, with the aim of being
able to present a complete accounting in six months' time.
The Prince appeared satisfied and allowed the minister
to retire. But he had scarcely passed the sill of the palace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
door when Hassan-Sebbah, approaching the King remarked
that if anything were needed to prove the
incapacity of the minister in a matter of this kind, it
was to be found precisely in the extraordinary delay that
he asked for putting the finances of the Empire in order.
This observation struck the Prince, who asked the courtier
making it if he wished to take charge of this work, and if
he would engage to have it finished in a shorter space
of time. Upon the affirmative response of the artful
Hassan, who only asked for forty days for the accomplishment
of the task, an order was given to Nizam-el-Moulk
to put the archives of the finances immediately at his
disposition, the <i>moustofis</i> (writings of the Chief Justice)
and all the details of the management. Hassan, delighted
at finding himself so suddenly at the head of
the most important branch of the administration, already
considered the complete ruin of Nizam-el-Moulk as assured.
The latter, on his side, perceived, but a little too
late, the imprudence he had been guilty of in placing
in so high a position a man whom he ought to have
known, and concerning whom he should have been on
his guard. However, he did not despair of frustrating,
scheme against scheme, the well-advanced projects of
his ambitious antagonist. Knowing by experience how
corruptible the men of his time were, and recognizing,
too, the proverbial greediness and weakness of character
of the confidant of Hassan-Sebbah to whom the latter believed
it possible to trust the work that he had undertaken
upon the order of Alp-Arslan, he did not hesitate to
furnish to one of his favorites, upon whose faithfulness
he knew he could count, sums large enough to be irresistible
in the carrying out of the plan which he had conceived.</p>

<p>The favorite of the minister, a safe man, accustomed to
this kind of service, so skilfully used this money that he
was not long in winning the good graces of Hassan's
weak and interested confidant, and was thus able to furnish
to his master all the information which he awaited
with impatience, and of which he could make good use
when the right moment was come. That moment was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
expiration of the forty days which Hassan-Sebbah had
demanded.</p>

<p>On the appointed day all was ready, and Hassan seemed
to triumph; but Nizam-el-Moulk had on that very day
when the voluminous record which his adversary had prepared
was to be put before the King in official audience,
given his favorite some final instructions which should
throw Hassan into confusion. This faithful and adroit
servitor went to find the confidant, whose confidence he
had gained by means of gifts, and begged him to show
him the wonderful statement which Nizam-el-Moulk had
declared could not be finished in less than six months,
and his master had had the skill to complete in forty
days. Hassan's confidant was occupied at this moment,
and besides, suspected nothing; he turned over to his
friend the <i>defter</i>&mdash;the bundle of detached leaflets which
formed the record. He, putting to good use the distraction
of the confidant, detached the <i>defter</i> and, in the
twinkling of an eye, confounded the order of the leaves,
as his master had recommended to him. Then, placing
the <i>defter</i> on the carpet, he launched forth into pompous
eulogy upon the skill of Hassan-Sebbah and of his worthy
acolyte who had so actively participated in this eminent
work. Some hours afterward Alp-Arslan received in
grand audience his ministers and officers of the Empire,
to assist at the solemn presentation of the financial accounting
of Hassan-Sebbah.</p>

<p>Nizam-el-Moulk humbly kept himself in one corner of
the audience hall, awaiting the result of his stratagem.
Upon the signal of Alp-Arslan, Hassan-Sebbah deposited
at the monarch's feet a <i>fhrist</i>, a little book (an index),
by means of which the Prince could call, in the order of
the provinces, for the leaflets contained in the <i>defter</i>,
which Hassan-Sebbah took from the hands of his trusted
helper. At the first call, Hassan sought in vain the desired
leaflet. He was haunted by treachery and was
troubled; the rumor that this incident provoked in the
hall, the presence of the King who was irritated at finding
such disorder in a compilation of this importance,
added to Hassan's confusion, and he was immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
forced to retire, after a severe reprimand on the part of
Alp-Arslan. Nizam-el-Moulk was avenged; he respectfully
approached the King and made the observation to
him that it was hardly to be expected that there would
be much regularity in so serious a work, done in such
haste by incapable people.</p>

<p>After this check, Hassan never again appeared at Court.
History tells us that he went on a voyage to Syria, where
he adopted the dogmas of the Ishmaelite sect, dogmas
that he resolved to import into Persia, adding to them
other novelties more in accordance with the opinions of
the Sufis, then very numerous in the kingdom, with the
aim of forming an army and becoming thus a terror
to his enemies. He did, in fact, return to Persia, but
concealed himself carefully, in order to escape the notice
of Nizam-el-Moulk, whose sentiments towards him he
suspected. He went back to his native city, Rhei, after
having lived for some time at Ispahan, where, emboldened
by the facility with which he made new recruits and
aided by his neophytes, he formed no less a project than
that of making the sovereign himself tremble on his
throne. At Rhei he drew around him some malcontents,
who did not hesitate to adopt the dogmas that he taught
them, and who declared themselves ready to second him
in his designs. He then resolved to go, with a limited
number of his disciples, and fortify himself in the mountain
of Alamout, near the city of Kazbin, where he commenced
to make raids on the surrounding country, by
means of which he provided for the needs of the moment
and prepared an equipment for his little troop, which
soon began to be formidable.</p>

<p>It was about this time that Alp-Arslan died, leaving
his vast estates to his son, Malek-Chah, whom he strongly
recommended to confide the administration to Nizam-el-Moulk,
his faithful and pious minister. But this minister
did not long enjoy these new favors. Malek-Chah, having
had the weakness to lend his ear to the calumnious reports
of his enemies, took away from him his turban and his
inkstand, insignia of the high functions which he had
so nobly fulfilled. This disgrace, facilitating a particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
vengeance, caused the death of the great statesman.
They found him one morning, stretched out under his
tent in the royal camp, assassinated by a satellite of
Hassan-Sebbah. Before he expired, according to the story
of the chronicle, he had time to write a piece of verse
to Malek-Chah, in which he recommended to his benevolence
his twelve sons, to whom, he said, he bequeathed
his old and loyal services.</p>

<p>Hassan-Sebbah did not the less continue his bloody
excursions, respecting neither rank nor sex, cutting the
throats of all that came under his hand, without pity.
Malek-Chah, frightened, was obliged to send troops to
put an end to these expeditions, which made trouble and
confusion in the whole extent of the Empire. But
Hassan's followers increased daily, and soon this chief
saw himself strong enough to repulse the royal troops
in a vigorous attack, and compel them to beat a retreat.
After this success, Hassan put no limit to his exploits,
and acquired such renown that nothing appeared to be
able to resist him.</p>

<p>The death of Malek-Chah took place unexpectedly soon
after that of Nizam-el-Moulk, and Hassan, hastening to
profit by some experiments of the celebrated Sultan
Sandjar, Malek-Chah's successor, there were incessant wars
in the different branches of the House of Seldjoukides,
wars which prolonged themselves until the death of
Tougroul III., or from forty to forty-five years. Sultan
Sandjar, rightly disturbed at the progress of Hassan's
invasion, resolved to entirely destroy a band of brigands
in his territory, whose depredations and murders had
spread terror in all the provinces. To this end, he re-organized
an army with which he marched in person
against the aggressors; but, arrived at a certain distance
from Mount Alamout, he saw one morning, upon waking,
a dagger sunk in the earth near the bolster of his bed,
whose blade pierced a note addressed to him, where he
read, with fright, these words:</p>

<blockquote><p>«O Sandjar! know that if I had not wished to respect your days,
the hand which sunk this dagger in the earth could as well have
sunk it in your heart.»</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span></p>

<p>It is said that the Sultan was so overcome by the
reading of this note, which revealed to him the marvellous
power of Hassan-Sebbah over his trusty followers,
that he relinquished for the time being his plan of attack.</p>

<p>But let us return to Khayyam, who, remaining a
stranger to all these alternatives of wars, intrigues, and
revolts with which this epoch was so filled, lived tranquilly
in his native village, giving himself up to a
passionate study of the philosophy of the Sufis. Surrounded
by numerous friends he sought with them, in
study and entertainment, that ecstatic contemplation which
others believe that they find in uttering cries and screams
until the voice is gone, as the crying dervishes do;
or in the circular movements that are practiced with
frenzy until vertigo ensues, as by the whirling dervishes;
or finally, in the atrocious tortures which the
Hindoos inflict upon themselves, until they lose consciousness.
The Persian historians state that Khayyam loved
especially to converse and drink with his friends, in the
moonlight on a terrace before his house, seated upon a
carpet, surrounded by singers and musicians, with a cup-bearer,
who, cup in hand, presented it in turn to the
joyous guests. We believe we cannot better terminate
this rapid biographical and historic sketch than in adding
to the life and works of our poet two very characteristic
quotations.</p>

<p>During one of these evenings of which we are speaking,
there suddenly came a gust of wind which extinguished
the candles and overturned the pitcher of wine that was
imprudently placed too near the edge of the terrace. The
pitcher was broken and the wine spilled. Immediately
Khayyam, irritated, improvised this impious quatrain, addressed
to the All-Powerful:</p>

<p>«Thou hast broken my pitcher of wine, my God!
Thus hast Thou shut upon me the gate of joy, O Lord!
It is I who drink, and it is Thou who committest the
disorder of drunkenness! Oh! (would that my mouth were
filled with earth!) couldst Thou be drunk, my Lord?»</p>

<p>The poet, after having pronounced this, casting his
eyes upon a mirror, perceived that his face was black as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
coal. It was a punishment from heaven. Then he made
this other quatrain, not less audacious than the first, and
which expresses in an absolute manner, the repulsion of
the poet for the doctrine of future punishment written in
the Koran, and preached so ardently by the mullahs.
The Sufis consider this doctrine not only in direct opposition
to their own, but as unworthy the pity and clemency
of the Divinity. Here is the quatrain:</p>

<p>«What man here below has not sinned, can you say?
And how could he have lived, had he not committed sin,
can you tell? So, if I do wrong and you punish me
wrongly, what is the difference which exists between
you and me, I ask?»</p>

<p>But let us come to the complete thought of the poet
which deduces itself so energetically and with so much
unity through the fantasy or the mysticism of his quatrains.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;The Translator being unfortunately familiar with at least
seven translations and paraphrases of Omar, has found it by no
means easy to expunge from memory the various renderings of the
text. This «sponging out» was necessary in order that a faithful
presentation of Nicolas' version of Omar should be made. With
this comment, he leaves the translation to be judged on its possible
merit, adding only this&mdash;that, declining metre (Fitzgerald's own
domain), he has sought to clothe the prose in verbal sonance which
should not disguise or mar the inherent music of the Omarian brook.
Fidelity to the text, however, has been the first consideration.</p></blockquote>

meaning of such Images must be to Europeans, they are not quoted
without «<i>rougissant</i>» even by laymen in Persia&mdash;«<i>Quant aux
termes de tendresse qui commencent ce quatrain, comme tant d'autres
dans ce recueil, nos lecteurs, habitués maintenant à l'étrangeté
des expressions si souvent employées par Khèyam pour rendre
ses pensées sur l'amour divin, et à la singularité de ses images
trop orientales, d'une sensualité quelquefois révoltante, n'auront
pas de peine à se persuader qu'il s'agit de la Divinité, bien que cette
conviction soit vivement discutée par les moullahs musulmans et
même par beaucoup de laïques, qui rougissent véritablement d'une
pareille licence de leur compatriote à l'égard des choses spirituelles.</i>»</p></div>

of the Ouseley MS. (O.). I do not propose to deal with them

or «Book of Pots.» It may be observed that the
quatrains in this section are not so closely rendered from recognisable
originals as the other quatrains composing FitzGerald's
poem. This may be accounted for by the fact that the
comparison between the human form&mdash;the Personal Ego&mdash;and
a pot made of earth by the Supreme Potter (if one may be
allowed the phrase) is constantly recurrent in all ruba'iyat attributed
to Omar Khayyam. The section is therefore to a great
extent a poetical reflection upon this phase of the philosophy of
the ruba'iyat. The use FitzGerald has made of O. 103 cannot

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
